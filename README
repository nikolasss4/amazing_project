📱 Project Description
This project is a mobile-first simplified trading application designed to make modern trading accessible, educational, and community-driven for everyday users.
The platform focuses on ease of use without sacrificing powerful features, offering multiple trading styles, social insights, and interactive learning — all wrapped in a clean, intuitive mobile experience.

🔁 Trading Features
The app supports several simplified trading modes:
Normal trades for straightforward buying and selling

The Learn section introduces trading concepts through gamified experiences, helping users build intuition without risk.
Users can:
Learn market fundamentals through interactive scenarios
Predict whether a stock or trend will move up or down based on given conditions

This approach makes financial education engaging, practical, and beginner-friendly.

User leaderboards and ranking tables
Ratings and performance-based comparisons
Scraped and curated celebrity and public portfolios for inspiration and analysis
Social insights sourced from platforms like Twitter, including sentiment and trending discussions related to stocks and markets
This section is designed to encourage learning through observation, competition, and shared knowledge.

🧩 Widgets & Integrations
The app includes custom widgets that allow users to quickly track:
